                Welcome to SuperRare! SuperRare is a decentralized application and
                digital art marketplace operating on the Ethereum blockchain. The
                SuperRare Platform uses specially-developed smart contracts that
                enable Artists to sell their digital creations to Collectors on a
                peer-to-peer digital marketplace. Collectors may trade, transfer,
                sell, or proudly display their collected SuperRare pieces on the
                SuperRare Platform.

            <ol>
              <li>
                1. Accessing the Platform through MetaMask
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    To most easily access and use the Platform, you should first
                    install the Google Chrome or Brave web browser. Once you
                    have installed Chrome or Brave, you will need to install a
                    browser extension called MetaMask. MetaMask is an electronic
                    wallet, which allows you to purchase (either directly via
                    Coinbase if you are in the United States, or via other
                    third-party sites), store, and engage in transactions using
                    the native Ethereum cryptocurrency, ETH. You will not be
                    able to engage in any transactions on the Platform other
                    than through MetaMask (or other Ethereum-compatible
                    browsers). The Platform will only recognize you as a User,
                    and you will only be able to interact with the Platform if
                    your Ethereum electronic wallet is connected and unlocked
                    through your MetaMask account. There is no other way to sign
                    up as a User or to interact directly with the Platform.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                2. Transactions Are Recorded on the Public Ethereum Blockchain
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Transactions that take place on the Platform are managed and
                    confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. The User understands
                    that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly
                    visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the
                    Platform. We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase,
                    Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or any other
                    third-party site, product, or service that you might access,
                    visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the
                    various features of the Platform. We will not be liable for
                    the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we
                    be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of
                    your transactions or any other interaction with any such
                    third parties.
